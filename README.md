# iOS Project Template

This is a template for making a new iOS app. To get started, run `make start`. Enter the name of your app, and the files will be updated to reflect it. Here's what is included:

* A modular set up for your project with scaffolding using [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).
* A basic app that includes a launch screen storyboard that will display your app name, and an app delegate.
* To create your project there is a make command, just run `make project`.
* To add a new module, run `make new-module` and it will walk through the steps and created the new module for you.
